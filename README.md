# Live Customer Response Activity
An issues-only repo to track [live customer support](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/dev_manual/LiveCustomerResponse.html) incidents and activity.

The VisIt team has taken measures to [integrate GitHub issues with our email list(s)](https://github.com/visit-dav/live-customer-response/wiki/How-the-new-GitHub-visit-users-Email-Integration-Works).

GitHub users currently using the `visit-users@elist.ornl.gov` email list for VisIt support are encouraged to use this issue tracker to submit questions, issues, etc. as an [alternative to using email](https://github.com/visit-dav/live-customer-response/wiki/GitHub-Issues-vs.-Email). 

VisIt users who do not yet have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) but would like one, are encouraged to sign up. They are free.

VisIt users who would rather continue using plain ole' email for VisIt support are free to do so.
