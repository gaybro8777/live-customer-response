We've tried to integrate visit-users email list with a GitHub issues repository. You can easily view this issue on GitHub. If you have a GitHub account, you can add and edit comments there, add large attachments and easily search historical information there. There are many other advantages to using GitHub issues for such interactions and the VisIt team encourages you to do so.
